## ‚úÖ **Practice Questions**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write a PHP program to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two numbers.
#### Ans:
```php
  <?PHP
    $no1 = 8;
    $no2 = 2;
    $add = $no1 + $no2;
    $sub = $no1 - $no2;
    $mult = $no1 * $no2;
    $div = $no1 / $no2;
    $remd = $no1 % $no2;
    echo "addition of ".$no1." and ".$no2." is ".$add."<br>";
    echo "subtraction of ".$no1." and ".$no2." is ".$sub."<br>";
    echo "multiplication of ".$no1." and ".$no2." is ".$mult."<br>";
    echo "division of ".$no1." and ".$no2." is ".$div."<br>";
